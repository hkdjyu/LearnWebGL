# Guide To Learn WebGL2

_a simple guide to learn WebGL2 AND share my progress of learning_

If you are new to WebGL2, you may also follow my steps to learn the fundalmentals concept of computer graphics in web applications using WebGL2. I am calling it a "guide" instead of "tutorial", because I am not a specialised WebGL programmer. I hope my experience may also help you to learn WebGL.  

> NOTE: This guide is not recommended for people with no prior knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript and computer graphics concepts.
> Prior knowledge of OpenGL and GLSL is not necessary but recommended.

This guide is primarily based on [WebGL2 Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/).
